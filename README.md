# 4-Bit-SIPO-Shift-Register
4-bit SIPO Shift register implemented on AMD Vivado tool &amp; Cadence Virtuoso tool

The SIPO shift register enables serial data input and parallel data output, making it useful for various applications, such as data buffering, data acquisition, and control systems. The basic operation of a SIPO shift register involves the sequential transfer of data bits through a series of flip-flops. The register has one input line called the serial input (SI) and parallel output lines (Q0, Q1, Q2, etc.) corresponding to each flip-flop. The clock signal (CLK) controls the shifting of data.
